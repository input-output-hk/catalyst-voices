      "dapp_purpose": "The DApp is useful within the **Financial Services** vertical by demonstrating a privacy-preserving KYC mechanism. This is a foundational step for regulated DeFi and lending platforms that need to verify user compliance (necessity) without becoming data honeypots (pattern: selective disclosure). It requires Midnight + Compact because the **proof logic must be executed privately** to ensure the user's data remains off-chain and only the valid proof of KYC is submitted. This is the core novelty, demonstrating a critical compliance primitive that public ledgers cannot offer.\n\n***\n\n* **Vertical:** Financial Services (Regulated DeFi/Lending)\n* **Pattern:** Selective Disclosure (Proof of KYC without revealing ID)\n* **Necessity:** Compliance with strict data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).\n* **Novelty:** Integration of Compact ZK proofs for an end-to-end, off-chain data verification and on-chain proof-of-compliance flow.",
      "build_goal": "We will build a **Private KYC Verification Compact DApp PoC**.\n\n* **Compact Contract(s):** `KycVerifier.compact` with a single key function, `verify_kyc_proof(proof: ZKProof) -> bool`, which checks the validity of an off-chain generated proof against a known verification key.\n* **Key Functions/Proofs:** The core proof function will assert: 'I, the prover, have a valid KYC document that meets $X$ criteria (e.g., Age > 18, not on sanction list) issued by $Y$ authority.'\n* **Demo UI Flow:**\n    1.  User connects Lace (Midnight) wallet.\n    2.  User uploads/selects their private KYC data in the client-side DApp (simulated).\n    3.  DApp generates the ZK proof using a client-side library.\n    4.  User submits the proof via a Compact transaction.\n    5.  DApp displays 'KYC Verified' or 'Verification Failed'.\n* **Lace (Midnight) Wallet Integration:** Used for authenticating the user and submitting the Compact transaction containing the ZK proof.\n* **Basic Test Plan:** Include unit tests for the Compact contract's `verify_kyc_proof` function using pre-generated valid/invalid proofs. End-to-end test script to simulate the UI flow from proof generation to on-chain submission.",
      "developer_reuse": "The repository will be structured to serve as a **reference implementation** for integrating privacy primitives into DApps.\n\n* **Repo Structure:** `/compact-contract` (Compact source, tests), `/demo-ui` (React/TS demo), `/docs` (tutorials, architecture).\n* **README Contents:** Clear getting started guide, quick-start commands (e.g., `npm run compact:build`, `npm run ui:dev`), and a conceptual overview explaining the ZK-KYC flow.\n* **Docs/Tutorials:** A tutorial on 'How to build your own selective disclosure proof' and an API-level document for the Compact contract entrypoints.\n* **Test Instructions:** Detailed instructions on how to run both Compact unit tests and the end-to-end flow test.\n* **Extension Points:** The contract will be modular, allowing developers to easily swap out the ZK-proof generation/verification parameters to suit different compliance needs.\n* **Benefiting Personas:** **DApp Devs** (reusable contract/UI), **zk-curious developers** (easy-to-read reference code), **Integrators** (clear API/flow docs).\n* **Gauge Impact:** Track **forks** (direct code reuse), **stars** (general interest), and monitor **issues/discussions** for community-led extensions or remixes of the core logic."

  "details": {
    "solution": {
      "solution": "The proposed solution is a minimal, fully functional **Proof of Concept (PoC)** for a **Private KYC Verification DApp**. It utilizes Midnight's **Compact Contracts** to verify zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) of off-chain private data. This addresses the problem of data exposure by ensuring that the only information submitted to the blockchain is a cryptographic proof that the user meets a specific compliance criterion (e.g., 'verified by ID provider $X$'), without revealing the user's name, address, or ID details. The technical approach involves: \n\n1.  **Client-Side Proof Generation:** User's data is verified off-chain by an oracle/client, which then generates a ZKP stating a fact about the data. \n2.  **Compact Contract Verification:** The ZKP is submitted via a Compact transaction to the `KycVerifier.compact` contract, which verifies the proof's validity privately. \n3.  **On-Chain State Update:** A minimal, non-identifying state (e.g., a simple boolean 'is_kyc_verified') is updated on the DApp's state for external, public-ledger DApps to query for permissioning, if needed. \n\nThis is unique because it combines ZKP with the programmable privacy of Compact Contracts, offering a compliant and private solution essential for bridging regulated industries to decentralized finance. It will benefit any DApp requiring access control based on sensitive attributes."

    "impact": {
      "impact": "This project will have a significant positive impact on the Midnight ecosystem by providing a **foundational, reusable, and compliant data-protection pattern**. \n\n* **In what way will the success of your project bring value?** It delivers a critical missing primitive: a practical, working example of private identity verification. This de-risks enterprise adoption by showing that regulatory requirements (like KYC) can be met while upholding privacy, attracting a wave of builders focused on compliance-heavy DApps (e.g., regulated exchanges, tokenized assets).\n* **How will you measure this impact?** \n    * **Quantitative:** Number of forks/stars on the public repository, community feedback/usage in other PoCs, and formal code review requests for the core logic.\n    * **Qualitative:** Testimonials from other builders who adopt the pattern, and its potential inclusion as a canonical example in Midnight's official documentation/tutorials.\n* **How will you share the outputs?** The full, working code will be open-source (MIT license). We will publish a detailed technical blog post and a **live, hosted demo** alongside the final Project Completion Video to make the PoC immediately accessible and understandable to developers."

The lead developer has contributed to multiple ZK-related libraries and has a strong GitHub portfolio.

The 3-month timeline forces a minimal, focused scope.\n* **Trust/Accountability:** Funds will be managed via a dedicated multi-sig wallet (or equivalent in the Midnight ecosystem). Milestones are tied to tangible, verifiable outputs (public code repository, passing tests, live demo link). Progress will be communicated bi-weekly via a public status report on the project's GitHub repo."
