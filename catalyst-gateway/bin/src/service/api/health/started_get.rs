///
/// Service Started endpoint.
///
/// Kubernetes (and others) use this endpoint to determine if the service has started
/// properly and is able to serve requests.
///
/// In this service, started is guaranteed if this endpoint is reachable.
/// So, it will always just return 204.
///
/// In theory it can also return 503 is the service has some startup processing
/// to complete before it is ready to serve requests.
///
/// An example of not being started could be that bulk data needs to be read
/// into memory or processed in some way before the API can return valid
/// responses.  In that scenario this endpoint would return 503 until that
/// startup processing was fully completed.
///
/// ## Responses
///
/// * 204 No Content - Service is Started and can  serve requests.
/// * 500 Server Error - If anything within this function fails unexpectedly. (Possible but unlikely)
/// * 503 Service Unavailable - Service has not started, do not send other requests.
