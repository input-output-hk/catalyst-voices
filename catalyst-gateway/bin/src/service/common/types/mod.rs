//! Common types
//!
//! These should be simple types, not objects.
//! For example, types derived from strings or integers and vectors of simple types only.
//!
//! Objects are objects, and not types.
//!
//! Simple types can be enums, if the intended underlying type is simple, such as a string
//! or integer.
