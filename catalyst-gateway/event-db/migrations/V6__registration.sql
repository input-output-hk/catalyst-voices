On update, an updating node, must check if the slot it is updating already exists.

If it is, it sets `update` to false, and just saves its update state with no further action.
This allows us to run multiple followers and update the database simultaneously.

IF the hash is different, then we need to handle that, logic not yet defined...

This table also serves as a central lock source for updates to the registration state 
which must be atomic.
Should be accessed with a pattern like:

```sql

        INSERT INTO cardano_update_state SET ...;  -- Set latest state
