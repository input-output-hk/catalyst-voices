        "\n\nEngineering and security best practices will be followed to implement the solution, in addition to consultation with both the Catalyst / Cardano community and internal IOG subject matter experts from cryptography, and game theory domains. Prior user research and community feedback informs our initial understanding of challenges to solve for. \n\nCatalyst Voices intends to develop iOS, Android, and Web applications from a single code base with near-native speed and performance. \n\nWe will approach the implementation of sets of features in terms of “modules”. Each module will correspond to a user role, segmenting the experience into sections aimed at completing specific actions. \n\nRole registrations, participation history, and saved preferences will unlock new aspects of the experience to help users engage at their own pace, on their own terms.\n\nLearnings acquired through developing and maintaining existing tools (such as Catalyst Mobile App, Voting Center, Snapshot Module) will be leveraged in order to rewrite the target development frameworks by building a single platform that is highly secure, extensible, and maintainable. While we anticipate unexpected challenges in integrating all features into a single platform, our plan to leverage battle-tested reference implementations should de-risk and accelerate development significantly. \n\nThe project will also benefit from maximizing the results of prior discovery and design research. Wireframes and mock-up designs created for and after user testing for the proposal submission module to replace Ideascale will continue to refine the UX with further user feedback gathered during the delivery of this project. This will include features and UX interactions for user profiles, cross-module navigation, and embedded guidance. \n\nFinally, the development of Catalyst Voices will follow the testing and deployment framework planned for the existing Catalyst stack. The latest experimental features will be deployed to a public devnet, and the latest stable features will be deployed to a public testnet. The community will have opportunities to engage with new features and provide feedback before promoting features to the production release candidate. \n\nRecurring voting events will run every 2-weeks on the Catalyst testnet to provide more frequent opportunities to engage with each of the phases of proposing, reviewing, and voting.\n"
