        "Through this 12 month project, the Catalyst Team proposes to unleash  the wisdom of the community by delivering a front-end web-browser based  application that radically lowers the barriers to meaningful  participation in collective decision-making for voters, representatives,  and proposers. \n\nA unified front-end interface to meet the needs  of the Catalyst community. Developed with continuous feedback from the  community, the Catalyst Team will deliver a unified experience to  replace the patchwork composed of wallets, Ideascale, standalone web  apps, and the Catalyst mobile app today. \n\nThe proposed product  design is informed by insights gleaned over nearly three years of  operating Catalyst, ongoing discovery research, and feedback from the  community. \n Prior feedback and research indicate 3 significant opportunities to improve the Catalyst experience with a unified platform:\nStreamline the experience by designing modules to serve the needs of each role"
