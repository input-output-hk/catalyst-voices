        "\n To  deliver this work we require a small team of rust backend developers,  QA engineers, front end developers, site reliability engineers and UI  designers.\n This is a moderately complex proposal due to the  development of fully decentralized role based access control to replace  the Web2 authorizations and user management required by Ideascale and  other typical systems. It will also require throughout the entire  project, Architectural Design to work on and refine the proposed CIPs  and other technical aspects of the system, Engineering Management to  keep the project on track, and Product Management that the final product  delights and empowers users across the community.\n This project  will also require regular updates to the community and high levels of  community engagement to properly respond to and evaluate feedback or  queries we are receiving. Especially as it relates to refining and  finalizing the CIPs necessary to underpin the operation of this  Project, which will also be critical work underpinning future work both  in Catalyst Voices and in future work envisioned for the “Athena”  distributed Project Catalyst which we ultimately desire to have all the  functionality proposed here.\n We will also be building and  deploying test versions of Catalyst Voices continuously to our internal  test deployments, and these will be publicly accessible. This is to  allow the community to easily see what state the development is in and  the available functionality without needing to run the system  themselves. We want to allow the greatest number of Project Catalyst  community members to track our progress as possible.\n"
