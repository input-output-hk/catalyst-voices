## Getting Started

### Bootstrapping

```sh
git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/catalyst-voices.git
cd catalyst_voices
melos bootstrap
```

This project contains 3 flavors:

* development
* staging
* production

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

# Staging
flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

# Production
flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart
```

*\*Catalyst Voices works on Web.
We plan to add iOS and Android later.*

## Running Tests

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
open coverage/index.html
```
