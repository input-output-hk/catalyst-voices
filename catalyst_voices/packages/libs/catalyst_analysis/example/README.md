It contains recommended lints for Catalyst Flutter apps, packages, and plugins.

The `catalyst_analysis` packages is listed as a `dev_dependency` in the `pubspec.yaml` file.

The lint set provided by the package is activated in the analysis_options.yaml file.
The lints enforced for this project can be further customized in that file.
