# Introduction and Goals

<!-- See: https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/ -->

## Requirements Overview

Project Catalyst is Cardanoâ€™s community funding program that enables open proposal submission and community voting.

Catalyst Voices provides the new client stack for proposal submission and voting across web and mobile.

This repository contains the user interfaces, the backend gateway, and utilities needed to run events end to end.

The scope covers proposal creation, collaboration, review, discovery, voting, and auditability for funded events.

The system must integrate on-chain registration and stake data to establish permissions and voting power.

The system must store user generated content and votes with cryptographic integrity and versioning.

The system must scale to global participation while remaining usable by non-technical users.
