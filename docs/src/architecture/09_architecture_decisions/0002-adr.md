## Context

Architecture Decision Records are part of [arc42].
We need an efficient and automated way to manage them.
The system needs to be easy for anyone to use as documenting Architecture Decisions is a team responsibility.

## Assumptions

* The team as a whole is responsible for creating and maintaining Architecture Decision Records.

## Decision

We will use the [MkDocs Material ADR Plugin] to assist in ADR documentation and automation.

## Risks

* The plugin doesn't get maintained or has technical issues

This risk can be mitigated because the plugin is simple, and it would be easy for us to fork and maintain it as required.

## Consequences

* ADR become easier for people to author.
* This should assist in making the team more pro-active in their creation and maintenance.
