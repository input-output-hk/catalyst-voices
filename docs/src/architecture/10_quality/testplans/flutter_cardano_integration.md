## General Informations

### Abstract

Catalyst Cardano is a web application that facilitate interaction with the Cardano blockchain.
It incorporates CIP-30 (Wallet DAppBridge) and CIP-95 (Message Signing) specifications.
It requires connection to the wallet third party extensions (e.g Eternl) to be able to perform wallet actions.
These actions are namely retrieving wallet details, signing data/transactions and submiting transactions.

### Stakeholders

| Role/Name       | Contact        | Approval       |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| *Eng-Manager*   |     Sasha      |                |
| *Developers*    |     Dominik    |                |
| *Testers*       |     Duy        |                |

### Requirements

[EPIC](https://github.com/input-output-hk/catalyst-voices/issues/399)  
[CIP-30](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-30)  
[CIP-95](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-95)  
Testing will be focused only on web applications for the time being.
Focus needs to be on compliance with CIP-30 and CIP-95 specs, reliability and security.
This is especially needed when handling wallet interactions and message signing.
UI testing is out of scope, the web application will be used only for setup purpose.  

### Acceptance criteria

* The package must comply with CIP-30 and CIP-95 specifications, focusing on the web.  
* High unit test coverage to ensure reliability and security.  
* Clear and comprehensive documentation for developers.  
* An example web application that effectively demonstrates the package's functionalities.  

### Risks

Documentation is not complete yet, integration dart package might be not enough  

### Tools

The main tool we will use is dart integration test package.
We still need to investigate if the testing can be achieved only with dart or if we need to use playwright for the web UI part.

## ACC framework

> :memo: **Note:** Use the [ACC framework](https://testing.googleblog.com/2011/09/10-minute-test-plan.html)
> to help you define the test cases

| \#  | OBJECTIVE | STEPS | EXPECTED RESULTS | TO BE AUTOMATED |
| --- | --------- | ----- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| 1   | Eternl extension installation success |  Start application, Download wallet chrome extention  | Displays message when Eternl extension is successfully installed | YES  |
| 2   | Eternl extension installation failure |  Start application, Download wallet chrome extention  | Displays error message handling when Eternl extension installation fails | YES  |
| 3   | Eternl extension detection |  Start application, Download wallet chrome extention | Displays message when the app correctly detects the presence of the Eternl extension | YES  |

## User actions

| \#  | OBJECTIVE | STEPS | EXPECTED RESULTS | TO BE AUTOMATED |
| --- | --------- | ----- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| 1   | User can retrieve his wallet details |  Start application, Download wallet chrome extention, Connect wallet extention in the application, Enable wallet  | Wallet details (balance, addresses, etc.) is correctly returned | YES  |
| 2   | User can sign data | Connect the wallet as #1, sign data | No exceptions are thrown, VkeyWitness is valid | YES |
| 3   | User can sign transactions | Connect the wallet as #1, sign transaction data | No exceptions are thrown, and in TransactionWitnessSet, atleast one VkeyWitness is present | YES |
| 4   | User can submit transactions | Connect the wallet as #1, submit transaction | No exceptions are thrown, Returned TransactionHash is not empty, Metadata is not included| YES |
| 5   | User can handle invalid transactions | Connect the wallet as #1, create and submit an invalid transaction (e.g., incorrect signature, insufficient funds, malformed data) | Appropriate error message is returned, Transaction is not processed | YES |
| 6   | User can submit transactions with metadata | Connect the wallet as #1, submit transaction with metadata | No exceptions are thrown, Returned TransactionHash is not empty, transaction is processed successfully with metadata | YES |
| 7   | User can submit transactions with auxiliary data set | Connect the wallet as #1, create and submit transaction with auxiliary data set, verify auxiliary_data_set existence | If auxiliary_data_set exists, process the transaction successfully, otherwise return None | YES |

## Wallet

| \#  | OBJECTIVE | STEPS | EXPECTED RESULTS | TO BE AUTOMATED |
| --- | --------- | ----- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| 1   | Empty wallet list |  Start application, Download wallet chrome extention, Connect wallet extention in the application  | Displays empty message when no wallets are available | YES  |
| 2   | Wallet enabling success |  Start application, Download wallet chrome extention, Connect wallet extention in the application, Enable wallet  | Displays message is displayed when enabling wallet success | YES  |
| 3  | Wallet enabling failure |  Start application, Download wallet chrome extention, Connect wallet extention in the application, Enable wallet  | Error message is displayed when enabling wallet fails | YES  |
| 4   | Error while loading wallet details |  Connect the wallet as #1  | Error message is displayed when loading wallet details fails | YES  |
| 5   | Sign data failure |  Connect the wallet as #1, sign data  | Error message is displayed when signing data fails | YES  |
