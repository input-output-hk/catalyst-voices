# Repo Documents

These files are replaced during the build with documentation files maintained
globally to the repo.

Such documents are importantly used not just inside the documentation, but also
for people browsing the source repository.

All files in this directory are just placeholders, until the documentation build
replaces them with the appropriate files.
