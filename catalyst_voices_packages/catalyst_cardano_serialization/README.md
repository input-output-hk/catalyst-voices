## Features

This package comes with serialization & deserialization of data structures related to Cardano
blockchain transactions and useful utility functions.

The goal of the package is to generate an unsigned transaction cbor that
can be signed and submitted to the blockchain.
The package communicates neither with the wallet nor with the blockchain therefore signing
and submission are outside of scope of this package.

## Requirements

* Dart: 3.3.4+
* Flutter: 3.22.1+

## Install

```yaml
dependencies:
  catalyst_cardano_serialization: any # or the latest version on Pub
```

## Example

Import `package:catalyst_cardano_serialization/catalyst_cardano_serialization.dart`,
instantiate `TransactionBuilder`, provide transaction inputs, outputs, add change address
for any remaining unspent UTXOs and build the transaction body.

The transaction body must be signed by witnesses in order to be submitted to the blockchain.
Otherwise the validity of the transaction could not be established and such transaction
would be rejected.
The caller must prove that they are eligible to spend the input UTXOs.

## Limitations

This package supports a minimal `TransactionBuilder` that does not yet work with
Smart Contracts or scripts.
However AuxiliaryMetadata is already supported thus it's possible to fulfill some of the use cases.
NFTs are partially supported, it's already possible to transfer them in a transaction.

Only Shelley era bech32 base and stake addresses are supported.
Byron era addresses are not supported.
