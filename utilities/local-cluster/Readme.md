# Local Cluster

Integration Tests and local testing will require a running local cluster.
To eliminate variability and simplify local deployment, we have standardized the local cluster around:

* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
* [Vagrant](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install?product_intent=vagrant)
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
* [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

These tools allow us to define VMs that are consistent and provide a uniform Kubernetes environment
for local testing.

## Cluster Architecture

The Cluster is based on [K3s](https://k3s.io/), which is a lightweight version of Kubernetes.

We set up 1 server node which hosts the control-plane and is the master node.
Configured with:

* 4 Cores
* 5 GB of RAM

It has 3 Internal nodes, configured as:

* 4 Cores
* 4 GB of RAM

## Default Services

These services are installed by default and provide the basic management and monitoring of the cluster.

* [Container Registry API](http://registry.cluster.test/v2/)
  * [HTTPS](https://registry.cluster.test/v2/)
  * [192.168.58.10:5000](http://192.168.58.10:5000)
* [Container Registry Web UI](http://registry-ui.cluster.test/)
  * Note: HTTPS not supported currently for this UI.
* [Traefik Ingress Dashboard](http://traefik.cluster.test/)
  * [HTTPS](https://traefik.cluster.test/)
  * [192.168.58.10:3000](http://192.168.58.10:3000)
* [Grafana Dashboard](http://grafana.cluster.test/)
  * [HTTPS](https://grafana.cluster.test/)
* [Prometheus Dashboard](http://prometheus.cluster.test/)
  * [HTTPS](https://prometheus.cluster.test/)
* [Alert manager UI](http://alert-manager.cluster.test/)
  * [HTTPS](https://alert-manager.cluster.test/)

### Scylla DB

This service is provisioned globally for use by services in the cluster.
It does not have a UI outside any Grafana dashboards that are installed.

For testing purposes, the ScyllaDB is accessible on the Cluster IP Address: `192.168.58.10`.

## Deploying the Cluster

### Setup hosts on windows

On Windows you need to setup the hosts before starting the cluster  
From Windows terminal open the hosts file:  

```sh
notepad %SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts  
```  

and copy the hosts from `./shared/extra.hosts` into the Windows host file  

### Startup

#### Linux/Windows

From the root of the repo:

```sh
just start-cluster
```

#### MacOS

From the root of the repo:

```sh
just start-cluster-aarch64-macos
```

### Getting Basic Cluster details

From the root of the repo:

```sh
just show-cluster
```

Note the report is **VERY** Wide.
Best viewed with a small terminal font.

### Suspending the Cluster

The cluster can be suspended to save local system resources, without tearing it down.

```sh
just suspend-cluster
```

### Resuming a suspended the Cluster

The suspended cluster can then be resumed with:

```sh
just resume-cluster
```

### Stopping the Cluster

```sh
just stop-cluster
```

## Catalyst Voices Services

These services are not deployed by default.

* [Catalyst Voices Frontend](http://voices.cluster.test/)
  * [HTTPS](https://voices.cluster.test/)
* [Catalyst Voices Backend](http://voices.cluster.test/api/)
  * [HTTPS](https://voices.cluster.test/api/)
* [Catalyst Voices Documentation](http://docs.voices.cluster.test/)
  * [HTTPS](https://docs.voices.cluster.test/)

### Deploying Catalyst Voices Frontend and Backend Services

TODO.

### Deploying Catalyst Voices Documentation Service

From the root of the repo:

 1. Make sure the documentation is built, and its container pushed to the container repo:

  ```sh
  earthly --push ./docs+local
  ```
<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line ol-prefix -->
2. Deploy the Documentation Service:

  ```sh
  earthly ./utilities/local-cluster+deploy-docs
  ```

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line ol-prefix -->
3. Stop the Documentation Service:

  ```sh
  earthly ./utilities/local-cluster+stop-docs
  ```

## Debugging the cluster

### SSH into a running VM

To SSH into a VM running the cluster, use `vagrant`:

```sh
vagrant ssh control
```

```sh
vagrant ssh agent86
```

```sh
vagrant ssh agent99
```

## Local UI to access ScyllaDB

Found (and tested) description how to connect using only open-source via DBeaver:

1. Download dbeaver (Community Edition)
2. Download cassandra jdbc jar files: <http://www.dbschema.com/cassandra-jdbc-driver.html>
   (Downloading and Testing the Driver Binaries section have links to binary and source)
3. extract cassandra jdbc zip
4. run dbeaver
5. go to Database > Driver Manager
6. click New
7. Fill in details as follows:
   * Driver Name: `Cassandra` (or whatever you want it to say)
   * Driver Type: `Generic`
   * Class Name: `com.dbschema.CassandraJdbcDriver`
   * URL Template: `jdbc:cassandra://{host}[:{port}][/{database}]`
   * Default Port: `9042`
   * Embedded: `no`
   * Category:
   * Description: `Cassandra` (or whatever you want it to say)
8. click Add File and add all the jars in the cassandra jdbc zip file.
9. click Find Class to make sure the Class Name is found okay
10. click OK
11. Create New Connection, selecting the database driver you just added
